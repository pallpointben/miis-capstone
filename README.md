**Project Description:** We are working with informational dialog agents that source data from knowlege bases. We are attempting to build an agent that can:
1) Recognize whether it does not know the answer to a user's question, or even understand the question, and take appropriate steps to gain the required understanding.
2) Continuously update its own internal knowledge base with information extracted from conversations with users, and apply that knowledge to future conversations.
