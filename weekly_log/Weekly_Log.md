2. Incorporate simulator in the dialogue system



## Tasks for 9/12-9/19

**All**

This week, we decided to put individual subprojects on hold and work together on one base module, the key value memory network. This will give us leverage in the future to write new code with an existing body in mind, rather than building something freeform and trying to figure out how everything fits together later.

## Tasks for 9/5-9/12

**Ben**
1. Determining ideal structure for question parse data to use in conjunction with oMDB API.
2. Preparing specification/interface for question parsing/key hashing module.
3. Began implementation of module in Python.


**Anusha**
1. Began work on learning-through-asking-questions module.
2. Designing the simulator for online training of chat-bot

**Pooja**
1. Understand end-to-end memory architecture for question answering.
2. Download and preprocess the WikiMovies dataset.
3. Implementing model architecture in PyTorch.

**Harini**
1. Study the details of the base architecture chosen.
1. Learn the designs of Key value memory network architecture and start implementation in PyTorch.

## Progress Since May
**All**
1. Continued literature review, discovering even more relevant papers for our topic.
2. Laid out discrete submodules of our project for each team member to work on.
3. Conducted review of several in-domain knowledge bases to use in our project and selected the best one (oMDB).
